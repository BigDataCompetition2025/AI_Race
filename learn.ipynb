    "什麼時候用它？\n",
    "當溫度感測點高度共線（很常見）且你希望自動選擇/壓縮特徵、降低過度擬合。ElasticNet 介於 Lasso 與 Ridge 之間，很適合這類多溫度感測器的資料。\n",
    "\n",
    "做法概觀\n",
    "\n",
    "讀取多個訓練 CSV 並合併；2) 只用數值欄（去掉目標）做特徵；3) 標準化；4) 用 ElasticNetCV（交叉驗證調 α 與 l1_ratio）；5) 以「每檔案第 101 筆起」計算競賽版 RMSE。\n",
    "\n",
    "注意：下方評估是「單一全域模型」在每個檔案上第 101 筆之後做預測；不會偷用第 100 筆之後的正解（避免洩漏）。\n",
    "\n",
    "可再加強的特徵（先把 baseline 跑起來再疊）：\n",
    "\n",
    "時間衍生：Time 的多項式/分段（因三階段轉速進給），或加「階段 one-hot」。\n",
    "\n",
    "溫度動態：移動平均/移動差分（例如各溫度 5/15 分鐘均值與斜率）。\n",
    "\n",
    "相對溫度：各點相對於環境基準（如 PT01 或全體平均）的差。\n",
    "\n",
    "以上都能用 pd.DataFrame.rolling() / .diff() 做出來，只要避免用到未來資訊即可（使用當下與過去）。"
